It is the graphical representation of the Raw data.

A. **Legend:** Each color represents a different data set in the analysis. The color matches with the Data lines (F). These elements can be modified in 'Files -> Processed data table'.

B. **Graph title:** If the study includes any preprocessing or modification before analysis, two graphs will be generated: "Preprocessed Data" and "Original Data". Otherwise, a single graph with the title "Raw Graph" will be generated.

C. **Y-axis:** Magnitude of the current. The units can be modified in 'Properties -> General -> Units -> Current (output)' and the range in 'Properties -> AC -> Y-axis range'

D.  **Concentrations:** Each gray rectangle represents a concentration in the chrono analysis. The elements have associated a concentration value and time, which can be modified in 'Properties -> AC -> Cards -> Fit Step Data -> Configure Concentrations'. All the elements share the same Step Fit (width).

E.  **X-axis:** Time. The units can be modified in 'Properties -> General -> Units -> Time (output)' and the range in 'Properties -> AC -> X-axis range'

F.  **Data lines:** Each color represents a different data set in the analysis. The color matches with the Legend (A). These elements can be modified in 'Files -> Processed data table'.
